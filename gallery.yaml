Our project is a multiplayer version of Dots and Boxes. At the start, Player 1 enters the number of participants (2, 3, or 4), then each player chooses a unique color for their lines. Players take turns drawing lines between dots. When a player completes a box, an “X” is drawn connecting the two opposite corners of the box, they earn a point, and take another turn. The game ends when all boxes are completed, and the player with the most boxes wins.
