## About

This project is a multiplayer version of Dots and Boxes for the final project of CS 3110 (Data Structures and Functional Programming). My role for the project had heavy emphasis on exploring OCaml GUI, as well as connecting our front- and backends. 

## Rules

At the start, Player 1 enters the number of participants (2, 3, or 4), then each player chooses a unique color for their lines. Players take turns drawing lines between dots. When a player completes a box, an “X” is drawn connecting the two opposite corners of the box, they earn a point, and take another turn. The game ends when all boxes are completed, and the player with the most boxes wins.
